* Add some associations
* Query API
 - Use a block that yields an object that has eq, <,>= and match functions on it
 - simple hash version (User.search(name: "Dan")) or User.search(name: match("Dan"))
 - Overload where in ActiveRecord::Relation to warn that it won't work as expected (because the initial dataset is constrained)
* Logging
* Collection schema
 - Rake task to
   - create collection
   - Detect changes and reindex (needs backend change)
