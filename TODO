* Add some associations
* Query API
 - Overload where in ActiveRecord::Relation to warn that it won't work as expected (because the initial dataset is constrained)

* Collection schema
 - Rake task to
   - create collection
   - Install (migrations for UUID and stash_id field)

* Config
 - workspace or profile
 - keys etc

* Queries
 - Range queries
   - between
 - String ordering
 - "all" index
 - check that chaining to create etc still works
 - count!
 - min/max
 - Option to use StashRelation as the default scope
 - Overide where! This really would make a 1-line change
 - Cast values to their field types so we could do something like dob > "1988-01-01"

* Errors
 - Proper error classes whenever we raise

* Tests
 - Test basic AR functions?
 - Query test

* Docs
- Getting started
 - encryped fields (rails or lockbox)
 - login
 - include
 - generator
 - (maybe) edit schema
 - run create task
 - run index task (or User.reindex)
 - Search API

Later
* Play with Cipher, Key Provider and Message Serializer
 * DSL
 - control what gets indexed
 - Ability to index fields from associations

* Docs
- Production
 - production config (cred bundle, credentials.enc)
