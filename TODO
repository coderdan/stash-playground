* Add some associations
* Query API
 - Use a block that yields an object that has eq, <,>= and match functions on it
* Split into gem
 - Use a Railtie for the tasks and generators
* Logging
* Config
 - Use Rails config via Railtie instead of profile with CLI?
 * Generator
 - Generate a stash schema (template) from existing model schema
 - Use dynamic matchers
 - Index everything
 - This may imply that we could keep plaintext indexes in stash for non-sensitive data
 - Overload where in ActiveRecord::Relation to warn that it won't work as expected (because the initial dataset is constrained)
 - We may also want to provide the ability to index related fields (from associations) to support more complex querying
 - Maybe we can use `where` instead of search
* Rake tasks
 - Wrap stash-cli
 - Helper to "stashify" existing model (creates migration for stash_id and uuid if needed)
* Collection schema
 - DSL?
 - Or maybe just JSON schema files in a directory (db/stash/users.json or something?)
 - Rake task to
   - create collection
   - create all collections ("migrate")
   - Detect changes and reindex (needs backend change)


Later
* Play with Cipher, Key Provider and Message Serializer
